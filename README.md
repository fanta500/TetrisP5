# TetrisP5
This is a little side project inspired by Code-Bullet's video on Tetris. 
I use lodash to make deep copies of shape objects.

If you want to play, simply clone or download and open index.html

Game Instructions:
p: pause/unpause game
spacebar: drop shape
down arrow: move shape down once
up arrow: rotate shape 90 degrees clockwise
left/right arrow: move shape left/right
